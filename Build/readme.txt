To host a server you just need to allow for UPnP connections to your router.
If your router does not have this functionality avaliable you might want to consider using a third party application to open the desired port. (Hamachi for example)
Whenever the server is running it will tell you which IP to give your companions to connect to it.
The desired port can be changed in the config.json.

(in case the server gets stuck before telling you your IP, press cntrl+c to make it go forwards)
